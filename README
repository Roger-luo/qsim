QSim is a Python package for simulating noisy quantum computers. The goal is to build in support for:
    - Both gate-based and Hamiltonian-based quantum computing
    - Different noise models
    - Monte Carlo and exact simulations
    - Parameter optimization routines in QAOA
...and perhaps in the distant future:
    - Intermediate measurements and feedback, as well as post-processing
    - Beautiful Sphinx documentation
